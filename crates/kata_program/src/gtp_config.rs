# ------------------------------
# Handicap
# ------------------------------
# Assume that if black makes many moves in a row right at the start of the
# game, then the game is a handicap game. This is necessary on some servers
# and for some GUIs and also when initializing from many SGF files, which may
# set up a handicap game using repeated GTP "play" commands for black rather
# than GTP "place_free_handicap" commands; however, it may also lead to
# incorrect understanding of komi if whiteHandicapBonus is used and a server
# does not have such a practice. Uncomment and set to false to disable.
# assumeMultipleStartingBlackMovesAreHandicap = true

# Makes katago dynamically adjust in handicap or altered-komi games to assume
# based on those game settings that it must be stronger or weaker than the
# opponent and to play accordingly. Greatly improves handicap strength by
# biasing winrates and scores to favor appropriate safe/aggressive play.
# Does NOT affect analysis (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by programs like
# Lizzie) so analysis remains unbiased. Uncomment and set this to 0 to disable
# this and make KataGo play the same always.
# dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead = 0.045

# Instead of "dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead", you can comment
# that out and uncomment and set "playoutDoublingAdvantage" to a fixed value
# from -3.0 to 3.0 that will not change dynamically.
# ALSO affects analysis tools (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by e.g. Lizzie).
# Negative makes KataGo behave as if it is much weaker than the opponent.
# Positive makes KataGo behave as if it is much stronger than the opponent.
# KataGo will adjust to favor safe/aggressive play as appropriate based on
# the combination of who is ahead and how much stronger/weaker it thinks it is,
# and report winrates and scores taking the strength difference into account.
#
# If this and "dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead" are both set
# then dynamic will be used for all games and this fixed value will be used
# for analysis tools.

# Passing and cleanup
# ------------------------------
# Make the bot never assume that its pass will end the game, even if passing
# would end and "win" under Tromp-Taylor rules. Usually this is a good idea
# when using it for analysis or playing on servers where scoring may be
# implemented non-tromp-taylorly. Uncomment and set to false to disable.
# conservativePass = true

# When using territory scoring, self-play games continue beyond two passes
# with special cleanup rules that may be confusing for human players. This
# option prevents the special cleanup phases from being reachable when using
# the bot for GTP play. Uncomment and set to false to enable entering special
# cleanup. For example, if you are testing it against itself, or against
# another bot that has precisely implemented the rules documented at
# https://lightvector.github.io/KataGo/rules.html
# preventCleanupPhase = true

# ------------------------------
# Miscellaneous behavior

# Search limits
# ===========================================================================

# Terminology:
# "Playouts" is the number of new playouts of search performed each turn.
# "Visits" is the same as "Playouts" but also counts search performed on
# previous turns that is still applicable to this turn.
# "Time" is the time in seconds.

# For example, if KataGo searched 200 nodes on the previous turn, and then
# after the opponent's reply, 50 nodes of its search tree was still valid,
# then a visit limit of 200 would allow KataGo to search 150 new nodes
# (for a final tree size of 200 nodes), whereas a playout limit of of 200
# would allow KataGo to search 200 nodes (for a final tree size of 250 nodes).

# Additionally, KataGo may also move before than the limit in order to
# obey time controls (e.g. byo-yomi, etc) if the GTP controller has
# told KataGo that the game has is being played with a given time control.

# Limits for search on the current turn.
# If commented out or unspecified, the default is to have no limit.

# 1.5KB, except when using whole-board ownership/territory
# visualizations, where each entry will take roughly 3KB. The number of
